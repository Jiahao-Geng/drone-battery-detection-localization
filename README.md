# Drone Battery Detection and 6D Pose Estimation
This project aims to utilize computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and estimate the 6D pose of a specific type of drone batteryï¼Œ  
whcih could be applied on automatic drone battery hot-swapping. 

# Project Objectives:
Detect the battery in images
Estimate the 6D pose of the battery
Provide precise positioning for robotic manipulator grasping
